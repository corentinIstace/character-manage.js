Project done by Corentin and Jérémie Lopopola
About the project :

The objective was to create a static site for a DJ, based on reference photos, responsive (desktop, tablet, and mobile sizes), with some animations and a burger menu.

It's create for my BeCode formation for learning the principles of:

    - HTML
    - SASS
    - Responsive web design
    - Javascript
    - Using GIT and Github

Objectives

For this exercice, it was asking to us to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.

After that we have to use responsive design and to push it on Github.
HTML:

    - write HTML proprely,
    - make the result looks like the picture,
    - respected the HTML sementic elements

SASS:

    - write SASS and link it with the css,
    - separate elements into different blocks,

Responsive web design:

    use the RWD media queries

Javascript: 

    
    - Use best JS practices
    - Read documentation and test a REST API
    - Use a REST API with HTTP requests
    - Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
    - DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests


Git and Github:

    create repository and clone it on our local machine,
